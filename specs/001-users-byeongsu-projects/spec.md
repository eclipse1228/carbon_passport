## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A traveler visiting Korea wants to understand the environmental impact of using KORAIL's train services. They create a personalized "carbon passport" that shows their eco-friendly travel routes through Korea, learn about KORAIL's ESG initiatives, and complete a survey to increase awareness about sustainable rail transportation.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a visitor on the home page, **When** they view KORAIL's ESG information, **Then** they should see clear information about carbon reduction and be prompted to create their carbon passport
2. **Given** a user creating a passport, **When** they enter their name and select their country (Korea, USA, Japan, or China), **Then** the system should display their country's flag and save traveler information
3. **Given** a user with entered information, **When** they input travel destinations, **Then** the system should display the travel route preview and carbon savings compared to other transportation methods
4. **Given** a completed passport creation, **When** the user views their passport, **Then** they should see personalized eco-friendly travel information and be prompted to participate in the ESG survey
5. **Given** a user completing the survey, **When** they answer all 6 questions about ESG awareness, **Then** the system should record responses and enable passport printing/sharing
6. **Given** a completed passport and survey, **When** the user chooses to share, **Then** the system should generate a unique shareable link with a hash identifier

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user selects a country outside the MVP scope (not Korea, USA, Japan, China)?
- How does the system handle incomplete traveler information?
- What happens if a user tries to skip the survey?
- How does the system handle route calculation failures?
- What happens when printing fails or is not supported by the browser?
